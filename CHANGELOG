Change Log
==========

Version 2.2
-----------

 - Bugfix: proxy object unlocks object when calling method and forced to roll
   back.
 - Bugfix: prevent object from being accessed after release.
 - Bugfix: early release checks versions before freeing object.
 - Increased granularity of locking at transaction start. Previously locks 
   were per registry, now they are per object.
 - API change: Transaction constructor no longer takes registries as arguments.
 - API change: No need to initialize TransactionsLock when starting up.
 - API change: "accesses" method is now generic.
 - API change: transaction.release(object) is now available (and should work). 
 - Concurrent unit tests.
 
 **Version 2.2 is currently in flux, so this list can change.**
