1. If experiencing errors with instrumentation such as:

		Class Instrumentation can not access a member of class ... with modifiers "public"
		Class Instrumentation can not access a member of class ... with modifiers ""
	
		Make sure that the class that implements shared objects is 
			a) public
			b) has public constructor
			c) the constructor is parameterless
